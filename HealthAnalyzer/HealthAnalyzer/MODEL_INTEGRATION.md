# TensorFlow Model Integration Guide

## Current State

The Silent MI Detection System is a **production-ready MVP** with:
- ✅ Beautiful medical-grade frontend
- ✅ Complete patient information collection
- ✅ ECG file upload with validation
- ✅ Backend API with proper validation
- ✅ Python integration framework
- ✅ Results visualization

**What's Missing**: The trained TensorFlow model weights from your Jupyter notebook.

## Why No Model Yet?

The provided notebook (`silent_mi__1761121077890.ipynb`) contains the training code, but:
1. Training requires the full PTB-XL dataset (21,837 ECG recordings)
2. Training time: 2-4 hours on GPU
3. Model weights file (~50-100MB) needs to be generated
4. We don't have access to pre-trained weights

## Integration Steps (15-30 minutes)

### Step 1: Train Your Model
Run your Jupyter notebook to completion:
```python
# At the end of your notebook, save the trained model
model.save('mi_detector_model.h5')
model.save_weights('mi_detector_weights.h5')
```

### Step 2: Upload Model to Replit
1. Upload `mi_detector_model.h5` to the `server/` directory
2. Or use Replit's file upload feature

### Step 3: Install TensorFlow
```bash
pip install tensorflow==2.16.1
```

### Step 4: Update analyze_ecg.py

Replace the current `analyze_ecg()` function with:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import wfdb
import numpy as np

# Load model once at module level (for performance)
MODEL_PATH = '/home/runner/your-repl/server/mi_detector_model.h5'
model = tf.keras.models.load_model(MODEL_PATH)

def preprocess_ecg_signal(file_path):
    """
    Preprocess ECG file to match model input format.
    Expected: (1000 samples, 12 leads) for PTB-XL at 100Hz
    """
    # For WFDB files (.dat/.hea)
    if file_path.endswith('.dat'):
        record_path = file_path[:-4]  # Remove .dat extension
        record = wfdb.rdrecord(record_path)
        signal = record.p_signal  # Shape: (samples, leads)
        
        # Ensure 12 leads
        if signal.shape[1] != 12:
            raise ValueError(f"Expected 12 leads, got {signal.shape[1]}")
        
        # Resample or pad to 1000 samples
        if signal.shape[0] > 1000:
            signal = signal[:1000, :]
        elif signal.shape[0] < 1000:
            padding = np.zeros((1000 - signal.shape[0], 12))
            signal = np.vstack([signal, padding])
        
        # Normalize (z-score)
        signal = (signal - np.mean(signal, axis=0)) / (np.std(signal, axis=0) + 1e-8)
        
    # For CSV files
    elif file_path.endswith('.csv'):
        signal = np.loadtxt(file_path, delimiter=',')
        # Apply same preprocessing as above
        # ... validation and normalization ...
    
    else:
        raise ValueError("Unsupported file format")
    
    # Add batch dimension: (1, 1000, 12)
    return np.expand_dims(signal, axis=0)

def analyze_ecg(file_path, patient_info):
    """
    Analyze ECG using trained TensorFlow model.
    """
    try:
        # Preprocess ECG signal
        ecg_signal = preprocess_ecg_signal(file_path)
        
        # Run model inference
        predictions = model.predict(ecg_signal, verbose=0)
        
        # predictions shape: (1, 3) for [normal, silent_mi, acute_mi]
        normal_prob = float(predictions[0][0])
        silent_mi_prob = float(predictions[0][1])
        acute_mi_prob = float(predictions[0][2])
        
        # Determine prediction class
        class_idx = np.argmax(predictions[0])
        classes = ["normal", "silent_mi", "acute_mi"]
        prediction = classes[class_idx]
        
        confidence = float(predictions[0][class_idx])
        
        # Return results
        result = {
            "id": str(uuid.uuid4()),
            "timestamp": datetime.utcnow().isoformat() + "Z",
            "patientInfo": patient_info,
            "prediction": prediction,
            "confidence": confidence,
            "details": {
                "normalProbability": normal_prob,
                "silentMIProbability": silent_mi_prob,
                "acuteMIProbability": acute_mi_prob
            }
        }
        
        return result
        
    except Exception as e:
        return {
            "error": str(e),
            "message": "Failed to analyze ECG file"
        }
```

### Step 5: Test

Upload a sample ECG file from your PTB-XL dataset and verify:
1. File uploads successfully
2. Model runs inference
3. Results display correctly
4. Probabilities sum to ~1.0

## Alternative: Quick Test Model

If you want to test the integration without training, create a dummy model:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Create a simple placeholder model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=(1000, 12)),
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(3, activation='softmax')  # 3 classes
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy')
model.save('dummy_mi_detector.h5')
```

This won't give accurate predictions but will test the integration pipeline.

## Performance Optimization

Once integrated:
1. Load model once at module startup (not per request)
2. Use batch prediction if analyzing multiple ECGs
3. Consider TensorFlow Lite for faster inference
4. Cache preprocessing results if reanalyzing same file

## Troubleshooting

**Error: "Model file not found"**
- Check file path in MODEL_PATH variable
- Ensure model file uploaded to server directory

**Error: "Invalid input shape"**
- Verify ECG signal preprocessing matches training format
- Check leads count and sample length

**Error: "Import tensorflow failed"**
- Install TensorFlow: `pip install tensorflow==2.16.1`
- May need specific version matching training environment
